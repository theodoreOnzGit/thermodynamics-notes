= Introduction

Thermodynamics for engineering is one of the most important modules 
required for an engineer to graduate. It is also easily one of the most 
hated, and for good reason.

Now, because it is so hated, difficult and confusing, I've decided to 
make some of my own notes for thermodynamics. I hope to be able to 
navigate some of its intricacies and confusing parts in order for some 
semblance of illumination to reach the brain. To do so, I've decided 
to split my thermodynamics notes into a few parts. 

Firstly, we cover the common topics. These are common across all engineering 
fields. Secondly, I have thermodynamics notes with a 
mechanical engineering bent where power cycles are more emphasised. 
Thirdly, I have a thermodynamics with a chemical engineering bent to it 
where chemical equilibrium is more heavily emphasised. The rest contain
thermodynamics in different applications.

For mechanical engineering, I will use Cengel's textbook along with 
some other notes @Cengel2011. For chemical engineering, Sandler's 
textbook @Sandler2017 is my textbook of choice.
